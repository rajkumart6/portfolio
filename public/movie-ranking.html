<h1>Best Movies according Rajkumar Tammisetti</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This one of my favaourite movie. The background voice Morgan Freeman narrating the story of the movie as it unflolds is what I love most about this movie</p>
<h3>God Father 1 & 2</h3>
<P>Its hard to not to have this as best movie. Just the way the director develops the main character of the movie is the best part of this movie.</P>
<h3>Notting Hill and Pretty Women</h3>
<p>These are really good ramantic comedy movies</p>
